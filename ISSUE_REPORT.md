| File:Line-Range | Severity | Category | Summary | Suggested Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data_pipeline/caching.py:39-74 | Medium | Insecure Deserialization | `pickle.load`/`dump` used for caching which may be unsafe for untrusted files | Validate cache source or switch to safer format such as JSON or joblib |
| data_pipeline/caching.py:128-138 | High | Weak Hash Function | Dataset fingerprints originally used MD5; replaced with SHA-256 | (fixed) |
| data_pipeline/transformation.py:410-416 | Medium | Missing Timeout | `requests.get` without timeout when fetching player data | Added `timeout=10` |
| data_pipeline/transformation.py:445-452 | Medium | Missing Timeout | `requests.get` without timeout when fetching rankings | Added `timeout=10` |
| tests/test_enhanced_transformation.py:208-216 | Low | Test Design | Test returns boolean value, causing PyTestReturnNotNoneWarning | Use assertions instead of returning values |
| .pre-commit-config.yaml | Low | Style | Windows-style CRLF line endings may cause tooling issues | Normalize to LF |


## Systemic Patterns
- Extensive use of `pickle` files for caching. While convenient, deserializing arbitrary files can be unsafe if caches become corrupted or attacker controlled.
- Network requests performed without explicit timeouts or retry logic leading to potential hangs.
- Heavy reliance on `print` statements rather than structured logging. This hinders debugging and log management.
- Tests sometimes return values instead of using assertions, which is unconventional for pytest.

## Autofix Plan
1. **Add network timeouts and stronger fingerprint hashing**
   - Files: `data_pipeline/transformation.py`, `data_pipeline/caching.py`
   - Test: `ruff check . && pytest -q`
2. **Replace pickle caches with safer serialization (e.g., JSON or joblib)**
   - Files: `data_pipeline/caching.py`
   - Test: `ruff check . && pytest -q`
3. **Normalize CRLF line endings in pre-commit config**
   - Files: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
   - Test: `ruff check .`
4. **Refactor tests to use assertions**
   - Files: `tests/test_enhanced_transformation.py`
   - Test: `pytest -q`
