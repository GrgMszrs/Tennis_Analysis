Classification based on match date with era-specific performance baselines for normalization.

---

## Z-Score Normalization Methodology

**Mathematical Foundation**: `z = (x - μ) / σ`

**Two Approaches**:
1. **Year-Only**: `z_year = (value - year_mean) / year_std`
   - Use case: Cross-surface comparisons within era
2. **Year+Surface**: `z_year_surface = (value - year_surface_mean) / year_surface_std`
   - Use case: Surface-specific specialist identification

**Normalized Metrics** (8 core × 2 approaches = 16 features):
- Ace rate, double fault rate, first serve percentage
- First/second serve win percentages
- Break point save percentage, return win percentage
- Service dominance (composite metric)

**Validation**: Mean ≈ 0, standard deviation ≈ 1 for all z-score features

---

## Player-Match Transformation

**Rationale**: Standard match data provides winner/loser statistics but lacks player-centric perspective for individual analysis.

**Implementation**: Each match generates two rows:
- Winner perspective: `won_match=True`, player stats as primary, opponent stats as secondary
- Loser perspective: `won_match=False`, player stats as primary, opponent stats as secondary

**Result**: 58,081 matches → 116,162 player-match records enabling consistent player-focused analysis.

---
