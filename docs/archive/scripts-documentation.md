## üìÅ Output Locations

These scripts save their outputs to:
- **Visualizations**: `data/output/plots/` (date patterns, joinability heatmaps, optimization charts)
- **Analysis Reports**: Console output with detailed formatting and statistics
- **Tournament Mappings**: Generated mapping tables and normalization examples
- **Performance Metrics**: Optimization results and recommendations

## üîß Requirements

These scripts require:
- Standardized data files in `data/cleaned_refactored/`
- Project dependencies installed via Poetry
- Python path configuration (handled automatically)
- Sufficient disk space for plot generation
- Optional: Internet connection for some analysis features

## üìã Integration with Main Pipeline

These scripts are **supplementary analysis tools** and are not part of the core data pipeline. They provide:

- **Data Quality Insights**: Validate and understand your data
- **Optimization Guidance**: Find optimal parameters for matching
- **Visualization Tools**: Create publication-ready charts and reports
- **Debugging Support**: Investigate data issues and pipeline performance

They can be run independently at any time after data standardization.

For the main pipeline, use:
```bash
poetry run python main.py
```
